- 👋 Hi, I’m @iMezaGit.
- 🛡️ I am a self-taught Cyber Security Analyst who recently completed the Google Cyber Security Certificate program. While this was my first step into the cybersecurity field, it provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the threat landscape and a solid foundation of technical skills. My primary goal is to leverage this knowledge to contribute to a safer digital world.
- 🌐 Currently, I am interested in the domains of network security and web application security, encompassing areas such as penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. It is worth mentioning that I am already undergoing training in platforms like HackTheBox and TCM security, evetually I will take the Practical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) certification exam.
- 💼 This repository serves as my professional portfolio, a way to exhibit my hands-on experience and showcase the diverse range of projects I've undertaken in the field of cybersecurity.
